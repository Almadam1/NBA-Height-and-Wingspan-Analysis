# NBA Height, Wingspan, and Defense Analysis

## Introduction
This project investigates the importance of height and wingspan in playing defense in the NBA. Using data from the 2021-2022 NBA season, the analysis aims to understand the success of teams based on average height, wingspan, and other defensive metrics.

## Objectives
- Analyze the impact of average height and wingspan on a team's defensive success.
- Evaluate the correlation between physical attributes and defensive metrics to determine what influences a team's success.

## Methodology
- Exploration of height and wingspan across different NBA teams.
- Correlation analysis between height, wingspan, and defensive rating.
- Investigation into how defense correlates with winning.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
